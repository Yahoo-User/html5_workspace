    <script>
        // The `DOMContentLoaded` event fires
        // when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed,
        // without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

        // The original target for this event is the Document that has loaded.
        // You can listen for this event on the Window interface to handle it in the capture or bubbling phases.

        // A different event, `load`, should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page.
        // It is a common mistake to use load where DOMContentLoaded would be more appropriate.

        window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
            console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
        });

    <!-- 
        1.  This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed
            after the document has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.
        2.  Scripts with the defer attribute will prevent the DOMContentLoaded event from firing
            until the script has loaded and finished evaluating.
        3.  This attribute must not be used if the src attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case it would have no effect.
        4.  To achieve a similar effect for dynamically inserted scripts, use async="false" instead. (***)
        5.  Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document.
